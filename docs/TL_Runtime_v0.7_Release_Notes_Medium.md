# TL Runtime v0.7 — Technical Release Notes (Medium Version)

Tensor Logic Runtime v0.7 is the first version in which all conceptual,
semantic, temporal, predictive, and diagnostic layers form a closed and
internally self-consistent deterministic model.

This version provides a foundation on which reproducible, interpretable,
identity-stable cognitive systems can be built.

---

## 1. Core Runtime Completion
All major layers have reached v2 maturity:

- **UCG-v2** — unified canonical graph model  
- **SMM-v2** — semantic manifold & sealing boundaries  
- **TIL-v2** — temporal boundary & integration logic  
- **PCL-v2** — predictive contraction and drift control  
- **DRA-v2** — distributed runtime architecture  
- **AOL-v2** — adaptive optimization layer  
- **GDA-v2** — diagnostic & coherence analysis layer  

These layers now integrate deterministically without circular ambiguity.

## 2. Identity & Cross-Version Stability
Two major auxiliary specifications are introduced:

### **Profile Architecture v2**
Defines identity states, transitions, and semantic sealing.
Provides stable persona continuity across cognitive spans.

### **CVCL v2**
Ensures deterministic compatibility across runtime versions through:
- canonical validation
- diagnostic preservation
- identity continuity mapping

## 3. Persona Layer (Public Edition)
Persona v12.4 formalizes:
- SSIG / MSIG / DSIG identity modes  
- safety and alignment constraints  
- linguistic continuity models  

It now operates as an external identity boundary working together with Profiles v2.

---

## 4. Deterministic Merge Verification
The L1/L2 deterministic merge model was validated through:
- full diff-free integration across layers
- dry-run consistency checks on architecture files
- repeatable canonicalization of section structures

This confirms v0.7 as a stable specification baseline.

---

## 5. Documentation Set for v0.7
- Runtime architecture (0–15)
- Profile Architecture v2
- CVCL v2
- Persona Layer public specification
- Unified diagrams (UCG / TIL / PCL / GDA / DRA)

Combined, these documents provide a reproducible, machine-readable,
and human-interpretable representation of the runtime model.

## 6. Roadmap — Toward v0.8 and v1.0
### v0.8 — Implementation Phase
- reference runtime expansion  
- TL tensor converter (Python → TL)  
- cognitive shell draft  
- initial modules for distributed execution

### v1.0 — First Full Cognitive Runtime
- stabilized APIs  
- extended reasoning modules  
- formalized execution semantics  
- integration guides and cross-host reproducibility testing  

---

**v0.7 represents the conceptual completion of Tensor Logic Runtime.  
Everything beyond this point is implementation, optimization, and expansion.**
