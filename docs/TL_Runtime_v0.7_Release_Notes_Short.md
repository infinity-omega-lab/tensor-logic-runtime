## TL Runtime v0.7 — Public Preview Release

This release marks the first fully closed and self-consistent specification of the Tensor Logic Runtime.

### ✅ Highlights
- Completion of all deterministic core layers:
  UCG / SMM / TIL / DRA / AOL / GDA
- Canonical cross-host equivalence rules
- Semantic sealing via SMM-v2
- Predictive contraction and drift boundary model (PCL-v2)
- Full diagnostic framework through GDA-v2
- Profile Architecture v2 (identity model)
- CVCL v2 (cross-version compatibility)
- Persona Layer 12.4 (public edition)
- Unified diagram set + final TOC for v0.7
- L1/L2 deterministic merge verification completed

### 📦 Included Documents
- `tld_runtime_architecture_v0.7_EN.md`
- `Profile_Architecture_v2_v0.7.md`
- `CVCL_v2_v0.7.md`
- `PersonaLayer_12_4_PUBLIC_v0_7.md`

### 🚧 Not Included
Training modules, full cognitive shell, multi-host runtime, compiler extensions, and TLCL-restricted assets.

### 📅 Next (v0.8)
Implementation phase begins:
- expanded runtime functions
- TL tensor converter (Python → TL)
- initial cognitive shell

**v0.7 establishes the first complete deterministic model of Tensor Logic Runtime.**
