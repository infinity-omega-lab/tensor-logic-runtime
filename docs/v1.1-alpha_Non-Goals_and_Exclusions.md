# v1.1-alpha Non-Goals and Exclusions

## Purpose

This document defines what is **explicitly out of scope** for v1.1-alpha.

Its role is to protect the semantic and executional integrity of the
Tensor Logic Runtime by clearly stating what **will not be implemented,
extended, or modified** in this cycle.

This is a *design freeze document*, not a roadmap.

---

## Category A — Semantic Changes (Strictly Forbidden)

The following are **permanently disallowed** in v1.1-alpha:

- Any modification to reduce semantics
- Any change to DomainBinder behavior or inference rules
- Introduction of implicit semantics or meaning inference
- Runtime-dependent semantic branching
- Auto-optimization that alters execution meaning
- Parallel execution that affects determinism

These changes would violate the frozen correctness baseline
established in v0.7.2 and are therefore prohibited.

---

## Category B — Execution Extensions (Explicitly Deferred)

The following features are **intentionally not implemented**
in v1.1-alpha, even though architectural hooks may exist:

- `avg` reduction execution
- `max` / `min` reduction execution
- Nonlinear or custom reduction executors
- Activation of the Future Execution Dispatch Layer
- Multiple execution strategy selection
- Runtime executor inference or switching

These capabilities are conceptually possible in future versions,
but remain **inactive and unreachable** in v1.1-alpha.

---

## Category C — Language and Interface Expansion (Out of Scope)

The following are excluded to prevent scope creep:

- Python or other language bindings
- Automatic Tensor Logic expression conversion
- External DSL or API layers
- Extended syntax beyond the v1.0 subset
- Expression sugar or shorthand operators

v1.1-alpha remains a **core runtime**, not an integration layer.

---

## Category D — Engineering Improvements (Explicitly Not Prioritized)

The following are intentionally postponed:

- Performance optimization
- Memory layout tuning
- Refactoring for abstraction
- API cleanup or reorganization
- Additional examples or demos
- Extensive documentation expansion

Any change justified as “cleanup”, “minor”, or “just a refactor”
is considered out of scope.

---

## Category E — Presentation and Positioning (Excluded)

The following are excluded from this cycle:

- Public claims beyond current executable capability
- README expansion describing future functionality
- Marketing-oriented diagrams or narratives
- Promises or timelines for unimplemented features

Documentation in v1.1-alpha reflects **only current behavior**
and established execution guarantees.

## Enforcement

All contributors and future work must treat this document as
**normative for v1.1-alpha**.

Any proposal that conflicts with these exclusions
must be deferred to a future version and documented separately.

---

## Summary

v1.1-alpha exists to **preserve correctness, not to expand capability**.

Its value lies in stability, clarity, and resistance to accidental change.
